# Lotka-Volterra model

The Lotka-Volterra model, names after Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra, is a set of differential equations used to describe the dynamics of biological systems, particularly in the context of predator-prey relationships. It's a fundamental tool in ecology and population biology for understanding how the populations of species interact with each other over time. 

The aim of this project is to simulate the Lotka-Volterra model for *two species*. The goal is to offers a quantitative understanding of the dynamics within a simplified predator-prey ecosystem and to convey these dynamics visually through animations. These animations will depict the fluctuations in both predator and prey populations over time and demonstrate their interdependence in phase space.

To clone the repository and initiate the simulation, the user should utilize the specified command line syntax, subsequently enabling the visualization of the animation:
